# 10 JavaScript functions to use everyday


This project is a boiler plate of functions used often by developers. The goal of this project is to have a code base ready for use but also available to practice when needed. These 10 JavaScript functions are basic but can be used daily for a variety of projects.

### Usage
To see functions working in the console:
- open up a web page
- right click to inspect, and open up dev tools
- copy and paste code in the console and press enter 
- you should see the console log for the function you pasted
